Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  If you downloaded this project from http://www.playframework.com/download then you'll find a prepackaged version of sbt in the project directory:

```
sbt run
```

And then go to http://localhost:9000 to see the running web application.

There are several demonstration files available in this template.
